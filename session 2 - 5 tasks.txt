task 1 

-command to generate ssh key on gitbash
Go to the folder where u wan to create key using cd , and below command

ssh-keygen -f linux-key #here linux-key can be 'name of the key'

task 2
create firewall(security grp on aws)

task 3
launch an aws ec2 instance

task 4 

now connect to ec2 using gitbash using below info

default user name for ec2 user is  ec2-user
I.P is public IP on instance -3.111.36.134
protocol is SSH
connecting using private key generated on gitbash (on task 1)

open gitbash and below command to connect to server(ec2 inst) from client (gitbash terminal)

syntax --> ssh -i <name of the key> <server user name>@<I.P address of the server>

ssh -i linux-key ec2-user@3.109.208.42 #linux-key is private key

then you are connected to the server you created

tASK 5 

practicing linux commands

cd / - root directory
cd - home directory
cd .. --> one step back
ls
ls -l (list with more info in alphabetic order)
ls -lr(r is reverse alphabetic)
ls -lt(latest on top)
ls -ltr(reverse time , latest at bottom)
ls -la(a is to show hidden files)
ls --help(to know all)


relative -->  to go to folder2 use cd folder2/ (scenario that you are already in folder1)

 and absolute paths - cd / home/folder1/folder2 (scenario that you are already in folder1)

CRUD (operations in any applications)- create read update delete

create in linux

touch <file-name> -->create file-name
cat > <file name> --> to add text 
ctrl +D to exit the file after writing
cat <file name> --> to read the file
cat >> <file name> --> append or add the text (since cat > <file nmae> will overwrite the file , we use >> to add to existing context)

mkdir --> to create folder/directory

rm <file name> -->remove in linux
rmdir <directory name> --> remove directory  (removes only empty directory)
rm -r <directory name> --> remove directory and files in it

mv <old file name> <new file name> --> to rename
