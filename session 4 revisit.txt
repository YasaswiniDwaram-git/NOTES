Session 4

Administration in Linux
----------------------------------------

sudo su --> super user login (# shows that you are logged as root user)
sudo su - --> will navigate to home folder of root user , which is /root
exit --> to exit sudo

useradd <usernmae> --> to create user
id --> info about currnet usrs
id <username> --> display user info along with grps he is in

when an user is created , a grp with same user name will be created

user info will be in /etc/passwd , so to view users cat /etc/passwd
/etc/group -->group info

passwd <username> --> to set passwd for username
groupadd <groupname>-->create group 
usermod -g <groupname> <username>--> add user to a group (here usermod to modify user , -g group )

each user has one primary and atleast one secondary group (can have multiple secondary grps)

usermod -aG <secondary-group-name> <username> --> to add user to secondary group ( -a is to append , G is to add user to secondary grp)

gpasswd -d <username> <groupname> --> delete user from grp  

when new person joins org    when person leaves org
--------------------------   -------------------------
create his user profile       remove users from group
create group                  delete the user
add user to the group

userdel <username> ---> delete user

groupdel <groupname> --> delete group

while deleting user add user to primary group and then delete user , so the group and user both will be deleted

else if you try to remove user when he is member in secondary group , then user cannot be removed from primary group

task -1

created user 'satya' and set passwd
login as satya using new window , ssh <username>@ip

linux will not allow passwd auth for users by default, only key based auth is allowed

so , we need to edit config file (in root ec2-user) to allow passauth and the command is

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config --> to edit config file and gives yes for passwordauthentication

systemctl restart sshd --> to restart

task 2

if you want to continue key based auth then user will create a key

in user terminal --> ssh-keygen -f <username>
cat <username>.pub 

ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEZv3SrVZWKonUf2QKPY4Ix4OIBE3Ap1Y4/6YQZ38/Jm yasaswini.dwaram@HDC2-L-W075WVT


 and provide it to admin (key is usually stored in .ssh directory in user folder )


so admin will go to that user directory --> cd <username>
 and --> mkdir .ssh(if it is not present then create) and 
touch authorized_keys --> to update the public key of new user

<usernmae> should have 700 on .ssh and 600 on authorized_keys 

go to satya folder , chown 700 .ssh and cd .ssh and chown 600 authorized_keys 

also name the folder as user(satya) chown -R satya:satya .ssh ( to give folder owner and grp name as ramesh , so only ramesh grp members have access)

to make sudo changes effective use --> sudo systemctl restart sshd command

in user terminal --> ssh -i <keyname> <username>@I.P

once done remove user from secondary grps first and then you can delete user
