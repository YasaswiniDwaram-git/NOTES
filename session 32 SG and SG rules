 

Since we pushed all to Git , we will take source from git to use the module

After changing source from local to git module ,terraform init -reconfigure 

Now we create AWS security grp for MYSQL server in aws using terraform
Name - expense-dev-mysql (project-env-server_name)

1.create a root module for SG 
2.use this module source for SG (just like you used for VPC)

###If you get same error even after doing init , Run terraform get -update to make sure the module dependencies are refreshed.

done with SG creation too...

you might add more and more resources and the state refresh will be done every time you plan and apply ..

it takes more time and also more API requests to aws from terraform...

so create resources on diff folders (which act as diff repos) (since this is small project we can just create a simgle folder and have sub folders of below )
expense-infra-dev (main folder)

1.VPC 
2.SG
3.mysql server
4.backend server
5.frontend server

To have a sequence , give numbers like 10-vpc , 20-sg , 30-mysql etc ...if any resource need to be added it can be done in the middle

WE need vpc_id to create SG , so since vpc module in diff repo can't be called right?

AWS systems manager Parameter Store (to store values or parameters in aws and can be used from data)
------------------
here you can save values of specific resources to use them later on creating more resources

create one using terraform and then store the vpc_id in SSM(parameters.tf)
name should be like - /expense/dev/vpc_id  (projectname - env - valuename)

Now you  have 

1.VPC 
2.SG
