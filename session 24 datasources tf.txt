Top to bottom approach
-----------------------
what is the problem? - manual infra
How terraform can solve? -- IaaC
Apply
 
to create infra (resources) in providers

	 auth
Iaac ---- API(provider.tf) -----> Providers

advantage - faster releases , less defects
				
To be able to create infra-
1. we need to know how aws service/resource works
2. we need to give inputs/arguments
3. providers will give the output
4.We can create more resources using the output too
				
				
Data sources
-----------------------

AMI ID changes whenever there's an updated , so we need to make sure the updated AMI id is updated on the code too

Can be achieved using querying existing info from providers which is possible to data source

so , we need GET API which can be done
