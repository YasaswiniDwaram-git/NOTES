package management
------------------------
yum or dnf

cd /etc/yum.repos.dnf --> to view kernel or repo info  i guess

yum install <?!> to install

yum/dnf list installed --> to view installed packages 

dnf list available  --> to view packages available to install

dnf remove git -y <to remove git>

how to check  (since proc is in root directory) (to go to root directory use cd /)
 cpu info --> cat /proc/cpuinfo
, memory info --> cat /proc/meminfo
, os that is used --> cat /etc/os-release

service management
---------------------------------------

start , stop , restart , status check , enable , disable (same name as command) (systemctl start/stop/restart/status/enable/disable )

systemctl status/start/stop sshd ( for status check )(this sshd is for ssh service)
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl disable nginx
systemctl restart nginx

http://ipaddress:80

process management
-----------------------------------
every process has an ID - PID
every process has parent process - PPID

to check process running --> ps -ef (here ps - processstatus , e - all , f-full format listing)

ps -ef | grep nginx

- if anyone ask if website is not responding  then check "systemctl status <ngnix or shh or smthng>" should be active
then ps -ef | grep <ngnix or shh or smthng> to check if running

FG -foreground ( runs in FG, so we can't perform anything on screen)

BG-background (runs in BG)

ex - sleep 100 (FG) (can't do/run anything for 100 sec on screen)
ex - sleep 100 & ('&' is to put process in BG ,process ID is shown )

top --> command to view monitor system performance and resource usage (to get out ctrl+C)

to kill process --> kill <PID> (request)
kill -9 <PID>  --> to force stop (order)

Network Management
----------------------------

netstat --> command to view network statistics

netstat -ltpn --> (l - to show listening sockets (actively waiting for connection) , t - to see TCP connections , p - to see program using sockets ,
                   n - numerical address of port)
