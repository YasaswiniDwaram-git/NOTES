session 36
-------------
Usually , when we try to connect to backend server (anything which are not in public subnet or has public access)
we are using bastion , so if we want to connect from other laptop r smthg , we require VPN
we create a VPN in public subnet and create rules for VPN to LB , servers to access them

From now , we can use VPN instead of Bastion

VPN usually done by citrix team



To do list  -
 VPN SG , VPN SG rules
 create key pair for VPN
 VPN instance with Open VPN (ami)
 connect as "openvpnas" username
 configure with default options to get admin and client UI (also create username and passwd)
 download openvpn connect and use client URL with vpn creds
 
Step1.
creating ec2 with ami -- (since the VPN is already installed and configured on this image, we launch this and make minor configs)
OpenVPN Access Server Community Image-fe8020db-5343-4c43-9e65-5ed4a825c931 (edit data according to AMI details)
Since this is a community AMI , we create public and private key(terraform resource) to create the VPN ec2

#key is already created in .ssh of home folder with openvpn name using ssh-keygen -f openvpn
resource "aws_key_pair" "openvpn" {
  key_name   = "openvpn"
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/openvpn.pub")
 
we create SG for vpn and open ports for backend lb,mysql,and backend server

for backend ALB_VPN -> open 80
backend servers --> 22 , 8080

also , vpn should have ports 443,943,1194 open on internet (you can use ingress and dynamic loop instead of adding rukes on SG)
since we are using ec2 instance , we open port 22 along with them

after configuring ec2(VPC) , SG and SG rules

WE COULD NOT USE THE AMI , as it has to be purchased , so below is exact process after configuring VPN(ec2 instance)

we connect to VPN (ec2 ) instance using ssh 

ssh -i ~/.ssh/openvpn openvpnas@public_ip  ## here we use openvpnas is default username 

give , yes and enter to use default settings ..it will ask to create password "Ramesh@72" (caps,num , spl char)

after running as you will get admin UI and client UI

Open Admin UI in browser and login using username and passwd ...

Go to VPN settings

Give Should client internet traffice be routed through VPN? - YES

Have clients use specific DNS servers - YES

primary and secondary DNS as 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (DNS for google)

Now openvpn (download), after installation give client URL , give username and passwd and IMPORT , enable it give passwd 

Now your IP will be changed as the pulic IP of VPN 

so , now instead of using bastion , you can use VPN and then ...directly access internal resources such

using anythinhgyiewsfi.app-dev.yashd.icu

Now , BACKEND (server)
----------------------
Approach 1
-----------
Create ec2 instance
confugure with backend
we usually do it with ansible , but if there's a new version ..we connect all instances and run the playbook using ansible..
in this process...stops server
				  remove old code
				  download new code
				  restart server

This approach has downtime and also traffic is increased during down time 

Approach 2
----------
Create ec2 instance
confugure with backend
stop the instance
take AMI
launch it using autoscaling

when traffice increases , autoscaling will take care of adding instances using AMI
