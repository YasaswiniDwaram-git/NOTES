session 31

REVISE one more time on how VPC and all explnataion to get clear idea

VPC creation resume from route tables , routes, route_table_association

video until 18:00 on (session -31)

routes creation , route table creation

So , watched VPC video according toit ,

1.create VPC
2.Create internetgateway and attach it to VPC
3. create subnets and associate them with VPC
4. create route tables
5.Associate route tables to subnets 
6. Now for public route table , associate the internetgateway from routes
7.create EIP
8.Create NAT gateway in public subnet and add EIP to it
9.Add NAT gateway to the routes in private and database subnets
10.Create subnet grp by adding (we'll have DB subnets here from 1a and 1b AZs)

VPC Peering
------------
This is to have private connection between to VPCs (in same account or not)

1.create peering from your VPC to the one required

we want to share communication from the subnets -pub and private (not database) to the default VPC, so 

Add the default VPC CIDR in pub and private route table (use default VPC CIDR and select peering as type)

Now , default VPC also has it's own igw and route table 

---------So , we add our own VPC CIDR in default VPC route table (route) by giving the CIDR and type as 


Resources to be created until now -

aws_vpc
aws_internet_gateway
aws_subnet (public , private and database 1 in each zone 1a,1b --tot 6 subnets)
aws_db_subnet_group (we'll have DB subnets here from 1a and 1b AZs)
aws_eip
aws_nat_gateway
aws_route_table (pub, private and database)
aws_route (pub , private and database)-associate private and database with NAT & pub with IGW
aws_route_table_association (associate subnets with routetables)

WE DO PEERING IN TERRAFORM NOW
-----------------------------

first , we need to ask if peering required or not so create a variable to ask

then we create

aws_vpc_peering_connection
aws_route --> we add route from our VPC to default VPC and vice versa

put readme.MD file accordingly with variables (optional and mandatory ) , outputs
