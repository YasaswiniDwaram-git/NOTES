functions ==filters
--------------------
we can't write custom functions in ansible , since ansible is developed in python we need to write code in py to get the functionality required
(mostly this won't happen since we use most from ansible functions)

filter --> manipulation

 - name: convert maps to list
      vars:
        data:
          name: "chinnu"
          age: 24
          location: "satya's heart"
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ data | dict2items }}"
       
gives the below list as output---

 "msg": [
        {
            "key": "name",
            "value": "chinnu"
        },
        {
            "key": "age",
            "value": 24
        },
        {
            "key": "location",
            "value": "satya's heart"
        }
    ]

now , we check vice versa

fatal: [localhost]: FAILED! => {"msg": "Failed to import the required Python library (netaddr) on ip-172-31-81-11.ec2.internal's Python /usr/bin/python3. Please read the module documentation and install it in the appropriate location. If the required library is installed, but Ansible is using the wrong Python interpreter, please consult the documentation on ansible_python_interpreter"}

for this error , it says we don't have latest python libraries installed so

check which version are needed using ansible --version

and pip3.9 install netaddr

if modules not in ansible , we use

ansible.builtin.command
ansible.builtin.shell

command vs shell ##interview 
--------------------
commands --> for simple commands , this will not get the shell environment
shell --> complex ones like pipes ,redirectories tec ,, this will get shell environment

command is secure than shell , since the command will not go into sever but shell does

expense project
------------------
3 servers
3 records mysql

welcomepage.yashd.icu  -->public I.P to give to users
backend.yashd.icu   -->private I.P
mysql.yashd.icu   -->private I.P
frontend.yashd.icu  -->private I.P

ansible not only used as CM tool , but can connect to any system is module is available

ansible --> AWS python library to create ec2-servers and interact

Console ,API , CLI , SDK(software development kit , for python - boto3 and botocore)  --> to interact with AWS

to create instance for aws using ansible
-----
in ansible documentation , check - ansible ec2 creation

in ansible server 

aws configure --> to access the account using key
