linux commands lesson 2
-------------------------

echo <any text> --> to print "any text"

uname --> to know kernel 
uname -a (to know more info) 
uname --help

so , in linux -(a,s,d,e,r,w,t,y,i) but --(name,char,help) two dash for words and one dash for alphabet

copy files syntax
cp <source file or source file path> <destination file> (bit confused ??revisit)

cut file (same command as rename)(see session 2)
mv <filename> <to directory where you want to move>

grep <word to find> <filename> --> to find a word in file
grep -i <word to find (can be case insensitive)> <filename>

download files from URL --

curl and wget

wget <URL> --> wget (is web get ,to download file using URL)

curl <URL> --> curl will not download but to shows the text directly on terminal (usually used to run scripts )

piping command symbol is "|" , out put of first command can be used as input of second command using piping

cut command (see in chatgpt for better understanding on cut and awk) (Simple and straightforward for basic column extraction.)
 
cut -d '<,></><any delimiter>' ( d- delimiter means symbols)
cut -c 1-5 (take characters from 1-5) or cut -c 2 (take character on '2')
cut -d '/'  f1,4  (This 'f' option specifies which fields (or columns) to extract after seperating using '/' (f1 means first field , f1.4 means 1 to 4 fileds)) 

awk command (Can perform complex operations such as calculations, conditional logic, and formatting, in addition to extracting data.)

awk -F '/' '{print $NF}' (prints by seperating Nth fragment using '/')

to print 1st fragment seperated by : , use awk -F ':' '{print $1F}' 

interview question - how to get list of users in liux server ..use --> awk -F ':' '{print $1F}' <users file>

head and tail commands syntax

head <filename> --> shows first 10 lines of context
tail<filename> --> shows second 10 lines of context

there is context of 10 lines , you need 5 lines from 5-10 , how ?

cat <filename> | head -n 10 |tail -n 5 (this takes first 10 and from that it will take last five )

tail -f <log-file> --> how to see running log (will be discussed in usr mgmnt)

if you need other than 10 lines then command is head -n 22 <filename> (here 22 is number of lines wanted)

wc -l -->word count in number of lines usage should be (cat <filename> | wc -l)
to get number of char wc -c (use wc --help for more)

Editor
------------------------------------
vim --> visually improved 
colon , insert , escape modes

change modes using below

command to esc = esc
esc to command = :

insert to esc = :
esc to insert = esc

to start editing give vim <file name>
press i (insert mode)
press escape (colon/command mode)


press i to start editing once done , if you want to save change and exit
command mode entered

press esc and then :wq
to quit without saving after editing esc and :q!
to quit without editing esc and :q

:set nu  --> to give s.no on lines (can be done after entering to esc only)
:sent nonu --> to remove s.no
:/<word to find> --> finds the word from top
:?<word to find> --> finds word from bottom
:noh --> no highlight
:%d --> to delete everything
:s/<word getting replaced>/<word replacing>--> substitute/replace a word (##replaces word only where the cursor is)
:s/<word getting replaced>/<word replacing>/g (##effective to whole line where cursor is places)
:ns/<word getting replaced>/<word replacing>/g (effctive to nth line)
:%s/<word getting replaced>/<word replacing>/g (effectivce to whole file)
:11d (deletes 11th line)
u-->undo
shift + G -->got to bottom line
gg--> got to top line
yy-->copy line
p-->paste line
10p --> pastes 10 times
dd-->deletes a line 

permissions
------------------------
'-' is for files 

-rw-r--r--

rw- owner of the group - u
r-- the grp in which owner belongs -g
r-- others -o

read -->4
write -->2
xecute -->1

if user is not assigned to any grp then grp name is also the user name

chmod ugo+rwx <filename>(gives all access to all user , grp members and others)

chmod u+r-w 

chmod 742 <filename> ( user has (4+2+1) , group has (4 i.e., read) , others have (2 , write)
