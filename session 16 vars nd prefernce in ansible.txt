Ansible playbook
---------------------
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 01.ping.yaml

just give 2 spaces after the task

vars:
    NAME: "Yash"
    age: "24"
    location: "hyd"
	
	tasks:
   - name: print the data
     ansible.builtin.debug: 
       msg: "Hi , I am {{NAME}} and {{age}} yr young and at {{location}} now" --> to declare variables {{}}
	   
damn with spaces in ansible

better not to change anything from source file , so instead of that we can put vars in a file and then use that file name on script to use all vars

play level vars
task level vars
vars from files
vars from prompt
vars from inventory
variables from inventory (passing arg)

1st preferecne is args/command line
2nd preference is for TASK level
3rd preferecne is from files
4th preferecne is from prompt
5th preferecne is from PLAY level
6th preferecne is from inventory

ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory.ini -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 01.ping.yaml ( so , -vvv will debug command )
