try performing session 7 without errors and then come back here , few commands might be missing in our notes , so check gitpage notes

theory
-------------------------------
last session has I.P adresses uploaded in the backend.service script and we can simply use domain name and hence

DNS (DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM)
--------------------------
mysalon.com , myvibe.com , mysql.devops.com --> returns an I.P address

domain registrars --> azure , aws, GCP , godaddy, hostinger(cheapest way) etc..

domain name is universally unique

ISP responsible for DNS resolution (providing name to I.P)

scenario--if you access facebook with new PC

browser checks its cache for facebook.com
browser contacts OS for IP address of facebook.com
OS checks cache now , but its NA

so now OS is enabled to contact ISP DNS resolver

DNS resolver checks its cache and contacts root servers (Root Servers are 13 in world , but there are replicas for these too)

TLD - TOP LEVEL DOMAINS -->.com .in .gov .edu and more

root server scans for the requested domain (facebook.com) and informs DNS resolver to contact .com TLD Root server

DNS resolver to contacts  TLD Root server to provide I.P address

TLD checks it's system to provide IP address of facebook.come

Records
------------------------------
just buying a domain won't do much ...deep dive on Records,

A record --> you have to update IP to your domain

.satya I should contact root servers that I started a TLD called .satya

Domain registars are middle man. now I connect all major domain registars to show my domain TLD

Domain registars inform TLD that some one bought facebook.satya domain

Domain registars update nameservers for the domain from TLD....

DNS resolver connects with TLD address... address is nothing but nameservers

Couldn't understand the theory but view the diagrams for it but practical is DONE
